# movierecommender-project


#### What are the (small) things to do when starting a new coding/ data science project?

- define question/problem that should be solved (e.g. use  a flowchart)
- create a repository on GitHub
- `git clone` the repository OR create a local project folder
- create a `README.md` file (e.g. with a ToDo list of things you want to implement)
- create a `.gitignore` file that contains paths/ file names you don't want to include in git
- create a `requirements.txt` that contains a list of python libraries
- create a file `.env` for your credentials (e.g. password to access a database)
- create a folder `models` that contains trained models
- create a folder `data` that contains your data files 
- create a folder for your source code (e.g. `src`, `recommenderapp`)
  - create a `utils.py` that contains functions/ constants that simplify your daily work
  - create other python modules
